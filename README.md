Simple Google App Engine App that receives constrained natural language updates on variables through google chat.

This program was written for a Google class on AppEngine that I took in Cambridge. The code is obviously not complete or production quality. It does, however, illustrate basic use of the DataStore, XMPP handling, Jinja2 templates (with extensions), and including external models (pyparsing).

I may or may not develop this further. There is a license, but it's the GPL, so feel free to fork it and use appropriately.
